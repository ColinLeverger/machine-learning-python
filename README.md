# Machine Learning with Python

Machine learning school project; we learned how to build, use and bench machine learning algorithms / mathematical models.

# Quick overview

## Goal of this project

The goal of this project was to have an overview of machine learning. 

We had to build & test algorithms, going from DQR to complex Data Analitic. Because we are only computer scientist yet (and not statistician), we played a lot with functions and benchmarked algorithms, by using our feeling. 

## Arborecence of the project

### Data Quality Report (first dataset)

- "./data": data used to generate the DQR,
- "./outputs": outputs of algorithm:
    + plotly HTML files with bars/graphs/hists...
    + DQR in csv
- "./screenshots": two screenshots of the plotly HTML graphs generated,
- "./DQR-V1.py" and "./DQR-V2.py": code used to generate DQR, two versions:
    + V1: with standards scikit library,
    + V2: coded from scratch!

For this first part, I worked with Valerian SALIOU (https://crisp.im).

### Modelling (second dataset)

- "./code": functions and code used in "./main.py"; generate models, tests, benchmarks, clean data...
- "./data": dataset used,
- "./dqr_outputs": outputs and graphs for DQR,
- "./main.py": code that will orchestrate the benchmarks of differents algorithms

For this second part, I worked with Anais GALISSON.

# First part: generate the Data Quality Report!

The DQR-generation step is an important part of the Data analytic process; with a clean report, it is possible de have insight about the data, to detect problems (missing values, strange values, outliers, etc.) and to make decision about these problems.
