# Machine Learning with Python

School project; we learned how to build, use and test machine learning algorithms wit mathematical models.

# About the 

# First part: generate the Data Quality Report!

The DQR-generation step is an important part of the Data analytic process; with a clean report, it is possible de have insight about the data, to detect problems 
(missing values, strange values, outliers, etc.) and to make decision about these problems.
